My work lies at the intersection of bioinformatics, genomics, marine biology, and microbial ecology.
I use environmental genomics and transcriptomics to identify and quantify the metabolic potential of marine microorganisms. In particular,
I look to apply bioinformatic methods to improve the efficiency of biofuel production and the sustainability of commercially grown algae.
Much of my work is funded from partnerships with companies interested in the commercial applications of my research.
 
In prior work, I have [revealed genetic factors that improve suitability for biofuel production](/publications/AlgaeGenome2021) and
[simulated the reaction of a keystone crustacean to the potential impacts of climate change](/publications/DaphniaPulicaria2022). 
My current and future dissertation work is centered around algal polysaccharides and the microbes that degrade them, which have implications in
energy production, aquaculture, and marine ecosystem dynamics.  

Automated monitoring of algae farms
-----
In one research project, I have collaborated with the Hawaiian algaculture company [Global Algae](https://www.globalgae.com/)
to develop an system that monitors the microbiome of commercially grown algae. In the first stage of the project, I
assembled the genome of a commercial <i>Nitzschia inconspicua</i> strain and revealed 
the genetic factors that made this strain suitable for biofuel production. These genomic resources are available at 
[the PhycoCosm portal at the Joint Genome Institute](https://phycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Nithil2/Nithil2.home.html) to power future algal research.

In the second stage of this project, I am building a pipeline for the automated processing of metatranscriptomic data from algae ponds. This would enable
near real-time decision making regarding the evaluation of growth conditions and provide early warnings about bacterial and viral contamination. I am also
using metatranscriptomic data to quantify how the diatom microbiome responds to different nutrient levels and other stresses.

Enzymatic degradation of macroalgal polysaccharides
-----
My dissertation work focuses on the sugars inside seaweeds, which are notoriously difficult to break down using physical or chemical treatments. I use the gut of the
herbivorous Hawaiian chub as a model system for studying the bacteria that degrade seaweeds in nature. This work is in parternship with the mariculture firm [Ocean Era](http://ocean-era.com/),
who are excited by the potential discovery of novel enzymes that can degrade macroalgae. If successful, this work would enable the integration of partially digested
seaweed compounds into commercial fish feed and improve the sustainability of aquaculture. Likewise, an more efficient method for algal decomposition improves
the viability of seaweed-based biofuel production.

Collaboration
-----
Throughout my research career, I have sought collaborations with a diverse array of academic, government, and industry partners.
I believe that high-throughput computational methods and the integration of big data into marine and microbial ecology will drive an explosion of new discoveries.
Thus, I find it crucial for bioinformaticians such as myself to collaborate with wet lab researchers and spread these methodological breakthroughs.
These partnerships have included not only collaborations at UC San Diego with the labs of ecologist [Prof. Jon Shurin](https://shurinlab.biosci.ucsd.edu/)
and molecular biologist [Prof. Stephen Mayfield](https://algae.ucsd.edu/mayfield/index.html),
but also government labs at the [Joint Genome Institute](https://phycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Nithil2/Nithil2.home.html),
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.



Past projects have included substantial collaboration with industry partners in Hawai'i, where I
[assembled the genome of a commercial <i>Nitzschia inconspicua</i> strain](/publications/AlgaeGenome2021)
for the algaculture company [Global Algae](https://www.globalgae.com/)
and explored the microbial communities in herbivorous fish guts with the mariculture firm [Ocean Era](http://ocean-era.com/).
These academia-industry partnerships have kept my research grounded and enabled further impact beyond scientific publications.
