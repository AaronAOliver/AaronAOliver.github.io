Hello! I'm Aaron, a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego in the [Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/cmbb) at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). I work in the lab of [Prof. Eric Allen](https://eallen.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), who holds appointments in Scripps and UC San Diego's School of Biological Sciences. I apply my background in computer science to explore communities of marine microorganisms using 'omics. My research and teaching are grounded in the idea that computational and bioinformatic methods are often underutilized and misunderstood in the marine sciences, especially ecology.

My work and research
------
I use environmental genomics and transcriptomics to . I have a particular . 

Collaboration in science
----
Application include substantial collaboration with industry partners in Hawaii, 


My background and history
------
I was initially interested in a career in software engineering, and worked as a undergraduate instructional assistant for two years in UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering. My specialty was the mathematical and theoretical bases of computer science. My topics of focus were algorithm design, discrete mathematics, probability, and runtime analyses. I later became interested in the algorithms of genome assembly and next generation sequencing, and eventually got my bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at UC San Diego before starting my PhD.
![I'm a born and raised San Diegan, and I've been very lucky to have geographical stability throughout my educational career. My elementary, middle, high, undergraduate, and graduate schools have all been within a 2 mile radius!](images/map_schools.jpg)
