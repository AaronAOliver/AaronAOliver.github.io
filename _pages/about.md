Hello! I'm Aaron, a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego in the [Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/cmbb)
at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). I work in the lab of [Prof. Eric Allen](https://eallen.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/),
which hosts researchers from both Scripps and UC San Diego's School of Biological Sciences.
I leverage my background in computer science to explore communities of marine microorganisms <i>in silico</i> for potential applications in bioenergy and biotechnology.
My research and teaching are driven by the belief that bioinformatic methods are often underutilized in marine biology, especially in ecology. 

Personal history
------
My initial dream job during college was a software engineer, and I worked as an [instructional assistant](/teaching/) for two years in UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering
during undergrad. My specialty was the theoretical bases of computer science, with a focus on [discrete mathematics](/teaching/CSE20), [algorithm design](/teaching/CSE101),
and [computational complexity](/teaching/CSE21). I became interested in genome assembly and sequence alignment during a course on advanced algorithms,
and eventually moved away from computer science theory in favor of computational biology. 
Before starting my PhD, I got my bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at UC San Diego.

I'm a fifth generation San Diegan, and I've had the incredible opportunity to remain local throughout my education.
My elementary, middle, high, undergraduate, and graduate schools have all been within a 2 mile radius!
