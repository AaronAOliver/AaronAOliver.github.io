Hello! I'm Aaron, a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego in the [Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/cmbb) at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). I work in the lab of [Prof. Eric Allen](https://eallen.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), which hosts researchers from both Scripps and UC San Diego's School of Biological Sciences. I apply my background in computer science to explore communities of marine microorganisms using 'omics. My research and teaching are grounded in the idea that computational and bioinformatic methods are often underutilized in the marine sciences, especially ecology. 

My research
------
My work lies at the intersection of bioinformatics, genomics, marine biology, and microbial ecology. 
I use environmental genomics and transcriptomics to identify and quantify the metabolic potential of marine microorganisms. In particular,
I look to apply bioinformatic methods towards solving big picture problems like sustainable energy production and climate resilience.  
In prior work, I have [revealed the genetic factors that enable high-throughput algal biofuel strain](/publications/AlgaeGenome2021) and
[simulated the reaction of a keystone crustacean to the potential impacts of climate change](/publications/DaphniaPulicaria2022). 
My current and future dissertation work is centered around algal polysaccharides and the microbes that degrade them, which has implications in
biofuel production, aquaculture, and marine ecosystem dynamics.  

Collaboration in computational science
----
Application include substantial collaboration with industry partners in Hawaii, [assembling the biofuel-relevant <i>Nitzschia inconspicua</i>] for the algaculture company [Global Algae](https://www.globalgae.com/) and exploring the microbial communities in herbivorous fish guts with the mariculture firm [Ocean Era](http://ocean-era.com/). 

1. collaborate across labs at ucsd
2. collaborate with government partners (jgi, pnnl, nrel)
3. collaborate with industry partners

Personal history
------
My ititial career goal during undergrad was software engineering, and I worked as a Computer Science [undergraduate instructional assistant](/teaching/) for two years in UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering. My specialty was the mathematical and theoretical bases of computer science. My topics of focus were algorithm design, discrete mathematics, probability, and runtime analyses. Through coursework, I became interested in the algorithms of genome assembly and sequence alignment, and moved away from theoretical computer science in favor of computational biology. I eventually got my bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at UC San Diego before starting my PhD.

I'm a fifth generation San Diegan, and I've had the incredible opportunity to remain local throughout my education. My elementary, middle, high, undergraduate, and graduate schools have all been within a 2 mile radius!
