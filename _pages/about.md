Hello! I'm Aaron, a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego in the [Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/cmbb)
at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). I work in the lab of [Prof. Eric Allen](https://eallen.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/),
which hosts researchers from both Scripps and UC San Diego's School of Biological Sciences.
I leverage my background in computer science to explore communities of marine microorganisms <i>in silico</i> for potential applications in bioenergy and biotechnology.
My research and teaching are driven by the belief that bioinformatic methods are often underutilized in marine biology.

## Personal history
Before starting my PhD, I got my bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at UC San Diego. I worked as an [instructional assistant](/teaching/) for two years in UC San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering
during undergrad. My specialty was the theoretical bases of computer science, with a focus on [discrete mathematics](/teaching/CSE20), [computational complexity](/teaching/CSE21), and [algorithm design](/teaching/CSE101).
I became interested in genome assembly and sequence alignment during a course on advanced algorithms, and eventually moved away from pure computer science theory in favor of computational biology. 

## Research Aims
In prior work, I [characterized an algae farm's most productive strain](/publications/AlgaeGenome2021) and
[simulated the reaction of a keystone crustacean to the potential impacts of climate change](/publications/DaphniaPulicaria2022). 
My current and future dissertation work is centered around algal polysaccharides and the microbes that degrade them, which have implications in
energy production, aquaculture, and marine ecosystem dynamics.  

###Enzymatic degradation of macroalgal polysaccharides
My dissertation work focuses on the sugars inside seaweeds, which are notoriously difficult to break down using physical or chemical treatments. I use the gut of the
herbivorous [Hawaiian chub](https://www.marinelifephotography.com/fishes/chubs/kyphosus-hawaiiensis.htm) as a model system for studying the bacteria that degrade seaweeds in nature. This work is in parternship with the mariculture firm [Ocean Era](http://ocean-era.com/),
who are excited by the potential discovery of novel enzymes that can degrade macroalgae. If successful, this work would enable the integration of partially digested
seaweed compounds into commercial fish feed and improve the sustainability of aquaculture. Likewise, an more efficient method for algal decomposition improves
the viability of seaweed-based biofuel production.

###Improving algae farm productivity
In one research project, I have collaborated with the Hawaiian algaculture company [Global Algae](https://www.globalgae.com/)
to develop an system that monitors the microbiome of commercially grown algae. In the first stage of the project, I
assembled the genome of a commercial <i>Nitzschia inconspicua</i> strain and revealed 
the genetic factors that made this strain suitable for biofuel production. These genomic resources are publicly available at the Joint Genome Institute's
[PhycoCosm portal](https://phycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Nithil2/Nithil2.home.html) to power future algal research. In the second stage of this project,
 I am also using metatranscriptomic data to quantify how the diatom microbiome responds to different nutrient levels and other stresses.

###Bioinformatics support
Outside of my primary research projects, I have also collaborated with wet lab biologists to integrate computational approaches into their studies.
In one project with the lab of ecologist [Prof. Jon Shurin](https://shurinlab.biosci.ucsd.edu/), I served as the primary bioinformatician and paired
gene expression data with life history changes to explain the response of <i>Daphnia</i> crustaceans to rising temperatures and predation stress. In an ongoing collaboration with
molecular biologist [Prof. Stephen Mayfield](https://algae.ucsd.edu/mayfield/index.html) and his lab, I am leveraging my experience with algae genomics to catalogue
how the promoters of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> differ between species. I might also play a supportive role, as in one study where I supported research programmer [Dr. Sheila Podell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YorpORcAAAAJ&hl=en)
in her discovery of potential [microbial contributions to a sponge's ability to degrade halogenated compounds](/publications/SpongeMicrobes2020).
