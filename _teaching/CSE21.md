Four quarters as a tutor-reader under [Distinguished Prof. Andrew B. Kahng](https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/~abk/) and [Prof. Miles Jones](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mej016/).
Responsibilities included grading, assignment and exam design, leading office hour sessions of more than 40 students, personalized one-on-one tutoring sessions.

This course covers the mathematical concepts used to model and analyze algorithms and computer systems. Topics include counting techniques (inclusion-exclusion; recursive counting; permutations and combinations), data representations, analysis of algorithms (order notation; time complexities; loop invariants), recurrence relations, graphs and trees (data structure representations; basic graph algorithms; special classes of graphs), and basic probability and its applications.
