One quarter as a tutor-reader under [Prof. Miles Jones](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mej016/).

This course will introduce the ways logic is used in computer science: for reasoning, as a language for specifications, and as operations in computation. Concepts include sets, relations, functions, equivalence relations, partial orders, number systems, and proof methods (especially induction and recursion). Propositional and predicate logic will be introduced and applied to various computer science domains such as circuit design, databases, cryptography, and program correctness.
