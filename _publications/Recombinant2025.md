Although much attention has been given to <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> as a model organism and commercial algae strain, many related strains actually exhibit better properties for commercial exploitation (growth rate, lipid content, thermotolerance). This new work shows that many of the genetic engineering techniques developed for <i>C. reinhardtii</i> can be seamlessly transfered to other promising green microalgae.
