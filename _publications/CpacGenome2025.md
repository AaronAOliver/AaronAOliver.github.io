We discovered an extremophile algae in some local pond scum, that exhibits high tolerance to high heat, pH, and salinity while being closely related to model organism <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. This will enable targeted growth of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> in outdoors ponds without using environmentally harmful chemicals to restrict the growth of competing organisms.
